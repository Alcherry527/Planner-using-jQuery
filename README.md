# Planner-using-jQuery

+This is an example of a workday planner for the average workday. One can put in things to do and reminders for what time they should be done between 9-5pm.

## Description
+ this page includes the planner above and in order for it to function required the use of local storage and is interactive for different users as a live site. 
+ the planner required the use of an external API: DayJS. This keeps the site up to date and the user's data up to date to the hour as well. 
+ the planner also uses different colored classes to help the user distinguish between time in the past and potentially things that are pst due, the present, and the future.
